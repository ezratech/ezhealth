- It is about making many small decisions throughout our lives. From choosing healthy alternatives over sugary foods to taking a walk instead of watching TV.

- Challenges will help users manage and figure out how to do what users want to do. Set goals to challenge yourself. Users break down plans and projects into small tasks that can be completed, repeated every day.
