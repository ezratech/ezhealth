> ## Challenges

- Becoming a healthier person is not about making a big change that affects the rest of our lives. It's about making many small decisions throughout our lives. From choosing healthy alternatives over sugary foods to choosing to go for a walk instead of watching TV. These little things add up by day, week, month, and year. So, when making life-changing decisions, we don't need to try to get over everything at the same time.
- Challenges will help users manage and figure out how to do things that users want to do. Set a goal to challenge yourself. Users will break down plans and projects into small tasks, which can be completed, repeating each day.
